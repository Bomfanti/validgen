## Requesting features
Feature requests are always welcome. Note that not all requests will receive an immediate response.

### Before submitting a feature request:
* Before submitting, **please check the validations table** below to see whether a specific validation is already implemented, planned, or will not be implemented.
* Check that the feature hasn't already been requested. Look at all issues with titles that might be related to the feature.
* Make sure you are running the latest version of the code, as the feature may already have been added. 

### When submitting a feature request:
* Be specific! The more details, the better.
* Small requests are fine, even if itâ€™s just adding support for a minor validation rule or a small enhancement.
* Include any relevant context, examples, or use cases to help us understand the need.
* Make sure your request is not a duplicate by searching the issue tracker first.
